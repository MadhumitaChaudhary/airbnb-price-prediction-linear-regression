# StayEstimate: AirBnB-Price-Predictor
The  project aims developing a model using linear regression to estimate Airbnb listing prices based on factors like accommodations, bathrooms, ratings, room type, cancellation policy, and cleaning fee. It assists hosts in pricing competitively and aids guests in informed booking decisions.
# Airbnb Price Prediction

 The project involves using a linear regression algorithm to analyze a dataset containing information about Airbnb properties based on factors mentioned above. By training the linear regression model on this data, the project seeks to understand the relationships between these variables and the prices of Airbnb listings. The ultimate goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a new Airbnb listing based on its features, helping hosts set competitive prices and assisting guests in making informed booking decisions.

## Project Overview

- The project uses Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy for data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
- The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of historical Airbnb property data with corresponding prices.
- The linear regression model is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, allowing us to understand the relationships between independent variables and prices.
- The model is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- The trained model can be used to predict the prices of new Airbnb listings based on their attributes, helping hosts set competitive prices and assisting guests in making informed booking decisions.
